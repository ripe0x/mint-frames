Mint Frames reduces the barrier to mint by enabling Zora mints within the Farcaster feed with eth and erc20 tokens. Until now, Zora NFTs were only available to mint in-feed with Warps. The Mint Frames tool gives creators a link to share that allows collectors to mint without needing to go to another site and connect their wallet to mint.

To get a Mint Frame for a Zora NFT, just drop a link to the Zora mint page into the field at drops.wtf and it will return a link to the frame. Once that returned link is shared on Farcaster, a frame appears that allows users to mint the nft right from the frame.

The frame supports mints with ETH and with ERC20 tokens on Base, Zora, and ETH L1 chains.
